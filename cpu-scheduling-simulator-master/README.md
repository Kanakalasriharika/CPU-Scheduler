CPU Scheduler Application
Overview

This project is a CPU Scheduler application developed using Java, Eclipse, and MySQL. It incorporates various scheduling algorithms, including First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Round Robin, to efficiently manage process scheduling. The application is designed to optimize CPU usage and minimize key metrics such as average waiting time, turnaround time, and response time.
Features

    Multiple Scheduling Algorithms: Supports FCFS, SJF, and Round Robin scheduling.
    Data Structures: Utilizes priority queues and linked lists for dynamic process management.
    Database Integration: Integrates with a MySQL database for process data storage and retrieval.
    Performance Monitoring: Tracks average waiting time, turnaround time, and response time for performance analysis.

Technologies Used

    Java: Core programming language used for developing the application.
    Eclipse IDE: Development environment for writing, debugging, and testing the application.
    MySQL: Database management system for storing and retrieving process data.
